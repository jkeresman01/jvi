/**
 * This is a simple interface to regular expressions.
 * It exists because the available regex packages have
 * different interfaces. This package does not contain
 * regular expression handling, rather it makes different regular
 * expression packages appear to have the same interface.
 * It supports compiling a regular expression, matching
 * a regular expression against a string and retrieving
 * the matched parenthesized subexpressions.
 * <p> This RegExp class is not directly instantiated.
 * Concrete classes that are derived from this class are available
 * though <a href="RegExpFactory.html">RegExpFactory</a>.
 * <p>
 * Fortunately the available packages all seemed to
 * be modeled after perl and
 * the capabilities are generally the same. For better documentation
 * on regular expressions refer to perl documentation or the excellent www
 * pages of the packages, noted below, that are adapted.
 * </p><p>
 * The regular expression packages that have adaptors
 * are <a href="http://javaregex.com/">
 * <b>com.stevesoft.pat</b></a>
 * and <a href="http://www.quateams.com/oro/">
 * <b>com.oroinc.text.regex</b></a>.
 * To use this software you must have one of the supported packages
 * installed on your system and available in the classpath.
 * </p><p>
 * Here are simple examples to demonstrate the use of this
 * software, not to teach you regular expressions.
 * </p><p><pre><code>
 *     RegExp re = RegExpFactory.create();
 *     re.setEscape('#'); // use '#' instead of '\' for sanity
 *     try {
 *         re.compile("#s?(#w+)#s+(#w+)#s?"); // 2 words and maybe white space
 *     } catch(RegExpPatternError) {
 *       e.printStackTrace();  // Prints implementation stacktrace
 *     }
 *     re.search("hello      world       ");   // returns true
 *     System.out.println(re.group(1)+" "+re.group(2)); // "hello world"
 * </code></pre></p>
 * <p>The example above shows direct access to the RegExp object
 * to get results. Alternately a result object can be obtained; it
 * has the same methods for access. So the end of the above example
 * could have been written as:
 * <pre><code>
 *     RegExpResult r = re.getResult();
 *     System.out.println(r.group(1)+" "+r.group(2)); // "hello world"
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * When searching a character array or a string can be specified to be
 * searched, and an index/offset from the beginning of the chars can also
 * be specified. If the index/offset is zero, then this is assumed to be
 * the beginning of line for use with the '^' anchor. If the index/offset
 * is greater than zero, then the character before the index/offset is
 * used to determine beginning of line.
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * <font size="+1">
 * Extensions
 * </font>
 * <br>Some extensions are available.
 * <ul>
 * <li>selectable escape character
 *     <br>There are two ways that the escape character can be
 *     specified. The <i>setEscape</i> method as seen in the
 *     above example. It can also be inlined in the pattern by
 *     starting the pattern with "(?e=#)" where '#' is any character
 *     you want for the escape character. This must be the start
 *     of the pattern.
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>There are features of the underlying packages that are
 * not available. In the future.....
 * </p>
