/**
 * This is a handle for a platform edit window.
 * It is used to abstract a platform container that holds the actual editable
 * component. There is no requirement for a platform to use this, but without
 * it certain jVi features are not useful, such as ":ls".
 * When used, the platform may,but is not required to,
 * include the editable component in the
 * implementation, and return it from getEditor.
 * <p/>
 * Note that a ViAppView may exist before the contained editor is
 * actually instantiated by the platform.
 * This interface is often used when an application allows multiple
 * open editors.
 * <p/>
 * NEEDSWORK: jVi generally keeps weak references to these.
 * <p/>
 * A platform may have editors that do not have a special container,
 * or for some reason jVi should not track the editor,
 * for example an editor in a dialog. Usually there is no user accessible
 * disk file associated with these editors.
 * jVi considers them  "nomadic" edtiors and
 * an AppView is not needed for these.
 * <p/>
 * The equality of two of these is based on equals. But in some situations
 * a platform may start working with the container before an editor component
 * is assigned to the container. ViManager has a method to cleanup "stale"
 * AppViews in this situation so that any storage that depends on equals,
 * for example a set, is fixed up. Note that if there is always a 1-1,
 * or 1-0, * relationship between Container and Editor then
 * equality can be based on Container.
