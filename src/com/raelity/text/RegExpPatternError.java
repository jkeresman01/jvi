/**
 * This exception occurs when a regular expression pattern
 * has an error and will not compile. It is thrown by the
 * RegExp adaptor if it catches an exception from the
 * underlying implementation. Unlike most exceptions it has a field
 * of type Throwable. This field is the implementation dependant
 * exception. The printStackTrace methods are overloaded to
 * print the machine dependant exception, since it may provide
 * detailed information about the problem.
 * Note that this class is derived from Error, if a regular expression
 * is built from user input this should be caught.
