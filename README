## Build ##

Post nbvi-2.0.9 jVi's build system is converted to gradle.
And NetBeans' jvi-wrapper build script does ant exec of gradle
then grabs the jar.

Note that frgall is used: target 11, source 19,
fraagl needs gradle 6.8.x, which means jdk-11 to jdk-15.


The root project can be opened in NetBeans. Sub projects are jvi-core,
jvi-swing and jvi-cmd. Set jvi-cmd as the main project and the debug and run
buttons work.

Doing "./gradlew build" creates two jars of particular interest
    jvi-swing/build/dist/jvi-swing.jar
        The jvi-swing.jar is a chubby jar and a copy of jvi-swing-<version>.jar.
        Look in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF see the verion information. For example:
            Artifact: com.raelity.jvi:jvi-swing
            ArtifactVersion: 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
        For NetBeans, jvi-swing.jar is a wrapped jar, with no additional jars.
        jvi-swing.jar has additional dependencies that are satisfied by
        NetBeans runtime.
    jvi-cmd/build/libs/jvi-cmd-<version>.jar
        This is an uber-jar use: "java -jar jvi-cmd-<version>.jar". Several
        netbeans jar files and guava are included.

In addition "./gradlew run" works.
