Editing with multiple windows and buffers.		*windows* *buffers*

The commands which have been added to use multiple windows and buffers are
explained here.  Additionally, there are explanations for commands that work
differently when used in combination with more than one window.

3.  Opening and closing a window	|opening-window|
4.  Moving cursor to other windows	|window-move-cursor|
5.  Moving windows around			|window-moving|
6.  Window resizing				|window-resize|
8.  Writing with multiple buffers	|buffer-write|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
3. Opening and closing a window				*opening-window*

CTRL-W s						*CTRL-W_s*
CTRL-W S						*CTRL-W_S*
CTRL-W CTRL-S						*CTRL-W_CTRL-S*
:[N]sp[lit] [+cmd] [file]				*:sp* *:split*
		Split current window in two.  The result is two viewports on
		the same file.  Make new window N high (default is to use half
		the height of the current window).  Reduces the current window
		height to create room (and others, if the 'equalalways' option
		is set and 'eadirection' isn't "hor").
START-DOC-DEL
		Note: CTRL-S does not work on all terminals and might block
		further input, use CTRL-Q to get going again.
		Also see |++opt| and |+cmd|.
STOP-DOC-DEL

CTRL-W CTRL-V						*CTRL-W_CTRL-V*
CTRL-W v						*CTRL-W_v*
:[N]vs[plit] [++opt] [+cmd] [file]			*:vs* *:vsplit*
		Like |:split|, but split vertically.  If 'equalalways' is set
		and 'eadirection' isn't "ver" the windows will be spread out
		horizontally, unless a width was specified.
		Note: In other places CTRL-Q does the same as CTRL-V, but here
		it doesn't!

Closing a window
----------------

CTRL-W c					*CTRL-W_c* *:clo* *:close*
:clo[se][!]	Close current window.  When the 'hidden' option is set, or
		when the buffer was changed and the [!] is used, the buffer
		becomes hidden (unless there is another window editing it).
		This command fails when:
		- There is only one window on the screen.
		- When 'hidden' is not set, [!] is not used, the buffer has
		  changes, and there is no other window on this buffer.
		Changes to the buffer are not written and won't get lost, so
		this is a "safe" command.

CTRL-W o						*CTRL-W_o*
CTRL-W CTRL-O					*CTRL-W_CTRL-O* *:on* *:only*
:on[ly][!]	Make the current window the only one on the screen.  All other
		windows are closed.
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.

==============================================================================
4. Moving cursor to other windows			*window-move-cursor*

CTRL-W <Down>					*CTRL-W_<Down>*
CTRL-W CTRL-J					*CTRL-W_CTRL-J* *CTRL-W_j*
CTRL-W j	Move cursor to Nth window below current one.  Uses the cursor
		position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W <Up>					*CTRL-W_<Up>*
CTRL-W CTRL-K					*CTRL-W_CTRL-K* *CTRL-W_k*
CTRL-W k	Move cursor to Nth window above current one.  Uses the cursor
		position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W <Left>					*CTRL-W_<Left>*
CTRL-W CTRL-H					*CTRL-W_CTRL-H*
CTRL-W <BS>					*CTRL-W_<BS>* *CTRL-W_h*
CTRL-W h	Move cursor to Nth window left of current one.  Uses the
		cursor position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W <Right>					*CTRL-W_<Right>*
CTRL-W CTRL-L					*CTRL-W_CTRL-L* *CTRL-W_l*
CTRL-W l	Move cursor to Nth window right of current one.  Uses the
		cursor position to select between alternatives.

CTRL-W w					*CTRL-W_w* *CTRL-W_CTRL-W*
CTRL-W CTRL-W	Without count: move cursor to window below/right of the
		current one.  If there is no window below or right, go to
		top-left window.
		With count: go to Nth window (windows are numbered from
		top-left to bottom-right).  To obtain the window number see
		|bufwinnr()| and |winnr()|.  When N is larger than the number
		of windows go to the last window.

						*CTRL-W_W*
CTRL-W W	Without count: move cursor to window above/left of current
		one.  If there is no window above or left, go to bottom-right
		window.  With count: go to Nth window, like with CTRL-W w.

CTRL-W t					*CTRL-W_t* *CTRL-W_CTRL-T*
CTRL-W CTRL-T	Move cursor to top-left window.

CTRL-W b					*CTRL-W_b* *CTRL-W_CTRL-B*
CTRL-W CTRL-B	Move cursor to bottom-right window.

CTRL-W p					*CTRL-W_p* *CTRL-W_CTRL-P*
CTRL-W CTRL-P	Go to previous (last accessed) window.

==============================================================================
5. Moving windows around				*window-moving*
START-DOC-DEL

CTRL-W r				*CTRL-W_r* *CTRL-W_CTRL-R* *E443*
CTRL-W CTRL-R	Rotate windows downwards/rightwards.  The first window becomes
		the second one, the second one becomes the third one, etc.
		The last window becomes the first window.  The cursor remains
		in the same window.
		This only works within the row or column of windows that the
		current window is in.

						*CTRL-W_R*
CTRL-W R	Rotate windows upwards/leftwards.  The second window becomes
		the first one, the third one becomes the second one, etc.  The
		first window becomes the last window.  The cursor remains in
		the same window.
		This only works within the row or column of windows that the
		current window is in.

CTRL-W x					*CTRL-W_x* *CTRL-W_CTRL-X*
CTRL-W CTRL-X	Without count: Exchange current window with next one.  If there
		is no next window, exchange with previous window.
		With count: Exchange current window with Nth window (first
		window is 1).  The cursor is put in the other window.
		When vertical and horizontal window splits are mixed, the
		exchange is only done in the row or column of windows that the
		current window is in.
STOP-DOC-DEL

The following commands can be used to change the window layout.  For example,
when there are two vertically split windows, CTRL-W K will change that in
horizontally split windows.  CTRL-W H does it the other way around.

NOTE: jVi typically has different semantics for CTRL-W [HJKL].
There are two cases to consider:
    1) when the window is at the edge of the area that contains editors.
    2) when there is an editor in the direction specified.
1) is as described here. For 2) the current editor is moved and becomes
a tab in the neighboring area.

						*CTRL-W_K*
CTRL-W K	Move the current window to be at the very top, using the full
		width of the screen.  This works like closing the current
		window and then creating another one with ":topleft split",
		except that the current window contents is used for the new
		window.

						*CTRL-W_J*
CTRL-W J	Move the current window to be at the very bottom, using the
		full width of the screen.  This works like closing the current
		window and then creating another one with ":botright split",
		except that the current window contents is used for the new
		window.

						*CTRL-W_H*
CTRL-W H	Move the current window to be at the far left, using the
		full height of the screen.  This works like closing the
		current window and then creating another one with
		":vert topleft split", except that the current window contents
		is used for the new window.
		{not available when compiled without the +vertsplit feature}

						*CTRL-W_L*
CTRL-W L	Move the current window to be at the far right, using the full
		height of the screen.  This works like closing the
		current window and then creating another one with
		":vert botright split", except that the current window
		contents is used for the new window.
		{not available when compiled without the +vertsplit feature}

						*CTRL-W_T*
CTRL-W T	Create a clone in a separate tab of the current editor.
START-DOC-DEL
CTRL-W T	Move the current window to a new tab page.  This fails if
		there is only one window in the current tab page.
		When a count is specified the new tab page will be opened
		before the tab page with this index.  Otherwise it comes after
		the current tab page.
STOP-DOC-DEL

==============================================================================
6. Window resizing					*window-resize*

						*CTRL-W_=*
CTRL-W =	Make all windows (almost) equally high and wide, but use
		'winheight' and 'winwidth' for the current window.

:res[ize] -N					*:res* *:resize* *CTRL-W_-*
CTRL-W -	Decrease current window height by N (default 1).
		If used after 'vertical': decrease width by N.

:res[ize] +N					*CTRL-W_+*
CTRL-W +	Increase current window height by N (default 1).
		If used after 'vertical': increase width by N.

:res[ize] [N]
CTRL-W CTRL-_					*CTRL-W_CTRL-_* *CTRL-W__*
CTRL-W _	Set current window height to N (default: highest possible).

z{nr}<CR>	Set current window height to {nr}.

						*CTRL-W_<*
CTRL-W <	Decrease current window width by N (default 1).

						*CTRL-W_>*
CTRL-W >	Increase current window width by N (default 1).

:vertical res[ize] [N]			*:vertical-resize* *CTRL-W_bar*
CTRL-W |	Set current window width to N (default: widest possible).
START-DOC-DEL

You can also resize a window by dragging a status line up or down with the
mouse.  Or by dragging a vertical separator line left or right.  This only
works if the version of Vim that is being used supports the mouse and the
'mouse' option has been set to enable it.

The option 'winheight' ('wh') is used to set the minimal window height of the
current window.  This option is used each time another window becomes the
current window.  If the option is '0', it is disabled.  Set 'winheight' to a
very large value, e.g., '9999', to make the current window always fill all
available space.  Set it to a reasonable value, e.g., '10', to make editing in
the current window comfortable.

The equivalent 'winwidth' ('wiw') option is used to set the minimal width of
the current window.
STOP-DOC-DEL

When the option 'equalalways' ('ea') is set, all the windows are automatically
made the same size after splitting or closing a window.  If you don't set this
option, splitting a window will reduce the size of the current window and
leave the other windows the same.  When closing a window, the extra lines are
given to the window above it.

The 'eadirection' option limits the direction in which the 'equalalways'
option is applied.  The default "both" resizes in both directions.  When the
value is "ver" only the heights of windows are equalized.  Use this when you
have manually resized a vertically split window and want to keep this width.
Likewise, "hor" causes only the widths of windows to be equalized.
START-DOC-DEL

The option 'cmdheight' ('ch') is used to set the height of the command-line.
If you are annoyed by the |hit-enter| prompt for long messages, set this
option to 2 or 3.

If there is only one window, resizing that window will also change the command
line height.  If there are several windows, resizing the current window will
also change the height of the window below it (and sometimes the window above
it).

The minimal height and width of a window is set with 'winminheight' and
'winminwidth'.  These are hard values, a window will never become smaller.

8. Writing with multiple buffers			*buffer-write*

							*:wa* *:wall*
:wa[ll]		Write all changed buffers.  Buffers without a file name or
		which are readonly are not written.
