VIM LICENSE

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts.

II) It <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> allowed to distribute <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> text must be included unmodified.
    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       <a href="motion.txt.html#a%29" class="d">a)</a> If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
          the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
          (in any way) for <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
          must make your changes, including source code, available to the
          maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
          include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
          maintainer will do with your changes and under what <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> they
          will be distributed <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
          then this license, or <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> later version, also applies to your changes.
          The current maintainer <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> Bram Moolenaar <span class="s">&lt;Bram@vim.org&gt;</span><a href="repeat.txt.html#." class="d">.</a>  If this
          changes <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
          vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> completely
          impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
          your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
          received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If you have received <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> modified Vim that was distributed <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a>
          mentioned under <a href="motion.txt.html#a%29" class="d">a)</a> you are allowed to further distribute <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a>
          unmodified, <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> mentioned <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> I).  If you make additional changes the
          text under <a href="motion.txt.html#a%29" class="d">a)</a> applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
          the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a>
          context diff.  You can choose what <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> to use for new code you
          add.  The changes and their <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> must not restrict others from
          making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
       d) When you have <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> modified Vim which includes changes <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> mentioned
          under c), you can distribute <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> without the source code for the
          changes if the following three conditions are met:
          <a href="motion.txt.html#-" class="d">-</a> The <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
            the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
            permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
            version of Vim without fee or restriction.
          <a href="motion.txt.html#-" class="d">-</a> You keep the changes for <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> least three years after last
            distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
            or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
            any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
            available to him.
          <a href="motion.txt.html#-" class="d">-</a> You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
            contact information must remain valid for <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> least three years
            after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> long
            <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
          you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
          any later version.
    3) <a href="insert.txt.html#A" class="d">A</a> message must be added, <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> least in the output of the ":version"
       command and in the <a href="intro.txt.html#intro" class="d">intro</a> screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> able to see that <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> was modified.  When distributing <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> only required for <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> far <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> this does
       not conflict with the <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> used for the changes.
    4) The contact information <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a>
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> small (e.g., <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> modified Makefile) e-mailing <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a>
     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a>
     <span class="s">&lt;maintainer@vim.org&gt;</span>

IV)  It <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> not allowed to remove this <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> from the distribution of the Vim
     sources, parts of <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> or from <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> modified version.  You may use this
     <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> for previous Vim releases instead of the <a href="uganda.txt.html#license" class="d">license</a> that they came
     with, <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> your option.

Kibaale Children's Centre                                               <a name="kcc" class="t">kcc</a>

Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC) <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> located in Kibaale, <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa.  The area <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> known <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> Rakai
District.  The population <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> mostly farmers.  Although people are poor, there
<a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> enough food.  But this district <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> suffering from AIDS more than any other
part of the world.  Some say that <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> started there.  Estimations are that 10
to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV.  Because parents die, there are
many orphans.  In this district about 60,000 children have lost one or both
parents, out of <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> population of 350,000.  And this <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> still continuing.

The children need <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> lot of help.  The KCC <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education.  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future.  KCC works on <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> Christian base, but help <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> given to children of any
religion.

The key to solving the problems in this area <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> education.  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars.  Now that the government <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections.  There <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a>
also help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food.

Most of the orphans are living in an extended family.  An uncle or older
sister <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> taking care of them.  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> low, <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> child <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> lucky if <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> gets healthy food.  Clothes, medical
care and schooling <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> beyond its reach.  To help these needy children, <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a>
sponsorship program was <a href="change.txt.html#put" class="d">put</a> into place.  <a href="insert.txt.html#A" class="d">A</a> child can be financially adopted.
For <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> few dollars <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> month KCC sees to <a href="motion.txt.html#it" class="d">it</a> that the child gets indispensable
items, <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it.

Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved.  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods.
There <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> demonstration school <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> the centre and teacher trainings are given.
Health workers are being trained, hygiene education <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> carried out and
households are stimulated to build <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> proper latrine.  <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> helped setting up <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a>
production site for cement slabs.  These are used to build <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> good latrine.
They are sold below cost price.

There <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> small clinic <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> the project, which provides children and their
family with medical help.  When needed, transport to <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> hospital <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> offered.
Immunization programs are carried out and help <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> provided when an epidemic <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a>
breaking out (measles and cholera have been <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> problem).
                                                        <a name="donate" class="t">donate</a>
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> spent <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> whole year <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> the centre, working <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a>
volunteer.  <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation.  <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps.
Now that I'm back in Holland, <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> would like to continue supporting KCC.  To do
this I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program.  Please
consider one of these possibilities:

1.  Sponsor <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> child in primary school: 17 euro <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> month (or more).
2.  Sponsor <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> child in secondary school: 25 euro <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> month (or more).
3.  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> month or quarter
4.  <a href="insert.txt.html#A" class="d">A</a> one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are
very low.  This <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> because the money goes directly to the centre.  Less than
5% <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> used for administration.  This <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> possible because this <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> small
organization that works with volunteers.  If you would like to sponsor <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a>
child, you should have the intention to do this for <a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> least one year.

How do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my
personal guarantee <a href="motion.txt.html#as" class="d">as</a> the author of Vim.  <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> trust the people that are working
<a href="motion.txt.html#at" class="d">at</a> the centre, <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> know them personally.  Further more, the centre <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a>
co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and
International Child Care Fund.  The centre <a href="motion.txt.html#is" class="d">is</a> visited about once <a href="insert.txt.html#a" class="d">a</a> year to
check the progress (at our own cost).  <a href="insert.txt.html#I" class="d">I</a> have visited the centre myself in
1996, 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2003.  The visit reports are on the <a href="uganda.txt.html#ICCF" class="d">ICCF</a> web site.
