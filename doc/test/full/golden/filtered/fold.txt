Folding						*Folding* *folding*

jVi supports several of the fold open/close commands.
The 'foldopen' option is supported.
The 'foldenable' and 'foldlevel' options are not supported.

3. Fold options		|fold-options|
4. Behavior of folds	|fold-behavior|

{Vi has no Folding}
{not available when compiled without the +folding feature}

2. Fold commands				*fold-commands* *E490*

All folding commands start with "z".  Hint: the "z" looks like a folded piece
of paper, if you look at it from the side.


OPENING AND CLOSING FOLDS ~

#*# table:form=ref:label=fold-commands 1:command 3:extra-or 17:desc #*#
							*zo*
zo		Open one fold under the cursor.  When a count is given, that
		many folds deep will be opened.  In Visual mode one level of
		folds is opened for all lines in the selected area.

							*zO*
zO		Open all folds under the cursor recursively.  Folds that don't
		contain the cursor line are unchanged.
		In Visual mode it opens all folds that are in the selected
		area, also those that are only partly selected.

							*zc*
zc		Close one fold under the cursor.  When a count is given, that
		many folds deep are closed.  In Visual mode one level of folds
		is closed for all lines in the selected area.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zC*
zC		Close all folds under the cursor recursively.  Folds that
		don't contain the cursor line are unchanged.
		In Visual mode it closes all folds that are in the selected
		area, also those that are only partly selected.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*za*
za		When on a closed fold: open it.  When folds are nested, you
		may have to use "za" several times.  When a count is given,
		that many closed folds are opened.
		When on an open fold: close it and set 'foldenable'.  This
		will only close one level, since using "za" again will open
		the fold.  When a count is given that many folds will be
		closed (that's not the same as repeating "za" that many
		times).

							*zA*
zA		When on a closed fold: open it recursively.
		When on an open fold: close it recursively and set
		'foldenable'.

							*zv*
zv		View cursor line: Open just enough folds to make the line in
		which the cursor is located not folded.

							*zM*
zM		Close all folds. This folds M-ore and M-ore.

							*zR*
zR		Open all folds. This R-educes folds until none left.
