1. Introduction						*intro*

Vim stands for Vi IMproved.  It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so many
improvements that a name change was appropriate.  Vim is a text editor which
includes almost all the commands from the Unix program "Vi" and a lot of new
ones.  It is very useful for editing programs and other plain text.
   All commands are given with the keyboard.  This has the advantage that you
can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on the screen.  For those
who want it, there is mouse support and a GUI version with scrollbars and
menus (see |gui.txt|).

An overview of this manual can be found in the file "help.txt", |help.txt|.
It can be accessed from within Vim with the <Help> or <F1> key and with the
|:help| command (just type ":help", without the bars or quotes).
   The 'helpfile' option can be set to the name of the help file, in case it
is not located in the default place.  You can jump to subjects like with tags:
Use CTRL-] to jump to a subject under the cursor, use CTRL-T to jump back.

Throughout this manual the differences between Vi and Vim are mentioned in
curly braces, like this: {Vi does not have on-line help}.  See |vi_diff.txt|
for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

This manual refers to Vim on various machines.  There may be small differences
between different computers and terminals.  Besides the remarks given in this
document, there is a separate document for each supported system, see
|sys-file-list|.

This manual is a reference for all the Vim commands and options.  This is not
an introduction to the use of Vi or Vim, it gets a bit complicated here and
there.  For beginners, there is a hands-on |tutor|.  To learn using Vim, read
the user manual |usr_toc.txt|.

							*book*
There are many books on Vi that contain a section for beginners.  There are
two books I can recommend:

	"Vim - Vi Improved" by Steve Oualline

This is the very first book completely dedicated to Vim.  It is very good for
beginners.  The most often used commands are explained with pictures and
examples.  The less often used commands are also explained, the more advanced
features are summarized.  There is a comprehensive index and a quick
reference.  Parts of this book have been included in the user manual
|frombook|.

	"Learning the Vi editor" by Linda Lamb and Arnold Robbins

This is a book about Vi that includes a chapter on Vim (in the sixth edition).
The first steps in Vi are explained very well.  The commands that Vim adds are
only briefly mentioned.  There is also a German translation.

4. Notation						*notation*

When syntax highlighting is used to read this, text that is not typed
literally is often highlighted with the Special group.  These are items in [],
{} and <>, and CTRL-X.

#*# table:form=ref:label=notation 1:command 14:extra-or 17:desc #*#
[]		Characters in square brackets are optional.

							*count* *[count]*
[count]		An optional number that may precede the command to multiply
		or iterate the command.  If no number is given, a count of one
		is used, unless otherwise noted.  Note that in this manual the
		[count] is not mentioned in the description of the command,
		but only in the explanation.  This was done to make the
		commands easier to look up.  If the 'showcmd' option is on,
		the (partially) entered count is shown at the bottom of the
		window.  You can use <Del> to erase the last digit (|N<Del>|).

							*[quotex]*
["x]		An optional register designation where text can be stored.
		See |registers|.  The x is a single character between 'a' and
		'z' or 'A' and 'Z' or '"', and in some cases (with the put
		command) between '0' and '9', '%', '#', ':' or '.'. The
		uppercase and lower case letter designate the same register,
		but the lower case letter is used to overwrite the previous
		register contents, while the uppercase letter is used to
		append to the previous register contents. Without the ""x" or
		with """" the stored text is put into the unnamed register.

							*{}*
{}		Curly braces denote parts of the command which must appear,
		but which can take a number of different values.  The
		differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces
		(this will be clear from the context).

							*{motion}*
{motion}	A command that moves the cursor.  See the list at
		|motion.txt|.  This is used after an operator command
		|operator| to move over the text that is to be operated upon.
		If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a
		count, the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w"
		deletes six words.  The motion can also be a mouse click.  The
		mouse is currently only supported for MS-DOS, Win32, Linux
		console with GPM and xterm under Unix.  The ":omap" command
		can be used to map characters while an operator is pending.

							*<character>*
<character>	A special character from the table below, optionally with
		modifiers, or a single ASCII character with modifiers.

							*'character'*
'c'		A single ASCII character.

							*CTRL-{char}*
CTRL-{char}	{char} typed as a control character; that is, typing {char}
		while holding the CTRL key down.  The case of {char} does not
		matter; thus CTRL-A and CTRL-a are equivalent.  But on some
		terminals, using the SHIFT key will produce another code,
		don't use it then.

							*'option'*
'option'	An option, or parameter, that can be set to a value, is
		enclosed in single quotes.  See |options|.

							*quotecommandquote*
"command"	A reference to a command that you can type is enclosed in
		double quotes.
#*#table:stop-table #*#

5. Modes, introduction				*vim-modes-intro* *vim-modes*

Vim has six BASIC modes:

#*# table:form=ref:label=vim-modes:todo=table-handling 1:command 19:extra-or 25:desc #*#
					*Normal* *Normal-mode* *command-mode*
Normal mode		In Normal mode you can enter all the normal editor
			commands.  If you start the editor you are in this
			mode (unless you have set the 'insertmode' option,
			see below).  This is also known as command mode.

Visual mode		This is like Normal mode, but the movement commands
			extend a highlighted area.  When a non-movement
			command is used, it is executed for the highlighted
			area.  See |Visual-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VISUAL --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Insert mode		In Insert mode the text you type is inserted into the
			buffer.  See |Insert-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- INSERT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Command-line mode  or	In Command-line mode (also called Cmdline mode) you
Cmdline mode		can enter one line of text at the bottom of the
			window.  This is for the Ex commands, ":", the pattern
			search commands, "?" and "/", and the filter command,
			"!".  |Cmdline-mode|
#*#table:stop-table #*#

There are five ADDITIONAL modes:

#*# table:form=ref 1:command 25:desc #*#
				*Operator-pending* *Operator-pending-mode*
Operator-pending mode	This is like Normal mode, but after an operator
			command has started, and Vim is waiting for a {motion}
			to specify the text that the operator will work on.

Replace mode		Replace mode is a special case of Insert mode.  You
			can do the same things as in Insert mode, but for
			each character you enter, one character of the existing
			text is deleted.  See |Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- REPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.
#*#table:stop-table #*#

==============================================================================
6. Switching from mode to mode				*mode-switching*

If for any reason you do not know which mode you are in, you can always get
back to Normal mode by typing <Esc> twice.  You will know you are back in
Normal mode when you see the screen flash or hear the bell after you type
<Esc>.  This doesn't work for Ex mode, use ":visual".

							*i_esc*
		TO mode					
		Normal	Visual	Insert	  Replace   Cmd-line
FROM mode						    
Normal			v V ^V	 *1	    R	    : / ? ! 
Visual		 *2		 c C	    --	      :     
Insert		 <Esc>	  --		  <Insert>    --    
Replace		 <Esc>	  --	<Insert>	      --    
Command-line	 *3	  --	 :start	    --		    

-  NA
-- not possible

*1 Go from Normal mode to Insert mode by giving the command "i", "I", "a",
   "A", "o", "O", "c", "C", "s" or S".
*2 Go from Visual mode to Normal mode by giving a non-movement command, which
   causes the command to be executed, or by hitting <Esc> "v", "V" or "CTRL-V"
   (see |v_v|), which just stops Visual mode without side effects.
*3 Go from Command-line mode to Normal mode by:
   - Hitting <CR> or <NL>, which causes the entered command to be executed.
   - Hitting CTRL-C or <Esc>, which quits the command-line without executing
     the command.
