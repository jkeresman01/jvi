*change.txt*    For Vim version 5.6.  Last change: 1999 Dec 21


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file describes commands that delete or change text.  In this context,
changing text means deleting the text and replacing it with other text using
one command.  You can undo all of these commands.  You can repeat the non-Ex
commands with the "." command.

1. Deleting text		|deleting|
2. Delete and insert		|delete-insert|
3. Simple changes		|simple-change|		*changing*
4. Complex changes		|complex-change|
   4.1 Filter commands		   |filter|
   4.2 Substitute		   |:substitute|
5. Copying and moving text	|copy-move|

For inserting text see |insert.txt|.

==============================================================================
1. Deleting text					*deleting*

#*# table:form=ref:label=deleting 1:command 10:extra-or 25:desc #*#
["x]<Del>	or					*<Del>* *x* *dl*
["x]x			Delete [count] characters under and after the cursor
			[into register x] (not linewise).  Does the same as
			"dl".  See |:fixdel| if the <Del> key does not do what
			you want.  See |'whichwrap'| for deleting the <EOL>
			(join lines).  {Vi does not support <Del>}

							*X* *dh*
["x]X			Delete [count] characters before the cursor [into
			register x] (not linewise).  Does the same as "dh".
			Also see |'whichwrap'|.

							*d*
["x]d{motion}		Delete text that {motion} moves over [into register
			x].  See below for exceptions.

							*dd*
["x]dd			Delete [count] lines [into register x] (linewise).

							*D*
["x]D			Delete the characters under the cursor until the end
			of the line and [count]-1 more lines [into register
			x]; synonym for d$ (not linewise).

{Visual}["x]x	or					*v_x* *v_d* *v_<Del>*
{Visual}["x]d   or
{Visual}["x]<Del>	Delete the highlighted text [into register x] (for
			{Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not in Vi}

{Visual}["x]X	or					*v_X* *v_D* *v_b_D*
{Visual}["x]D		Delete the highlighted lines [into register x] (for
			{Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  In Visual block mode,
			"D" deletes the highlighted text plus all text until
			the end of the line.  {not in Vi}

						*:d* *:de* *:del* *:delete*
:[range]d[elete] [x]	Delete [range] lines (default: current line) [into
			register x].

:[range]d[elete] [x] {count}
			Delete {count} lines, starting with [range]
			(default: current line |cmdline-ranges|) [into
			register x].
#*#table:stop-table #*#

These commands delete text.  You can repeat them with the "." command
(except ":d") and undo them.  Use Visual mode to delete blocks of text.  See
|registers| for an explanation of registers.

An exception for the d{motion} command: If the motion is not linewise, the
start and end of the motion are not in the same line, and there are only
blanks before the start and after the end of the motion, the delete becomes
linewise.  This means that the delete also removes the line of blanks that you
might expect to remain.

Trying to delete an empty region of text (e.g., "d0" in the first column)
is an error when 'cpoptions' includes the 'E' flag.

#*# table:form=ref:label=FIXME 1:command 3:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*J*
J			Join [count] lines, with a minimum of two lines.
			Remove the indent and insert up to two spaces (see
			below).

							*v_J*
{Visual}J		Join the highlighted lines, with a minimum of two
			lines.  Remove the indent and insert up to two spaces
			(see below).  {not in Vi}

							*gJ*
gJ			Join [count] lines, with a minimum of two lines.
			Don't insert or remove any spaces.  {not in Vi}

							*v_gJ*
{Visual}gJ		Join the highlighted lines, with a minimum of two
			lines.  Don't insert or remove any spaces.  {not in
			Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#

These commands delete the <EOL> between lines.  This has the effect of joining
multiple lines into one line.  You can repeat these commands (except ":j") and
undo them.

These commands, except "gJ", insert one space in place of the <EOL> unless
there is trailing white space or the next line starts with a ')'.  These
commands, except "gJ", delete any leading white space on the next line.  If
the 'joinspaces' option is on, these commands insert two spaces after a '.',
'!' or '?' (but if 'cpoptions' includes the 'j' flag, they insert two spaces
only after a '.').


==============================================================================
2. Delete and insert				*delete-insert* *replacing*

#*# table:form=ref:label=delete-insert 1:command 10:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*R*
R			Enter Replace mode: Each character you type replaces
			an existing character, starting with the character
			under the cursor.  Repeat the entered text [count]-1
			times.  See |Replace-mode| for more details.

							*c*
["x]c{motion}		Delete {motion} text [into register x] and start
			insert.  When  'cpoptions' includes the 'E' flag and
			there is no text to delete (e.g., with "cTx" when the
			cursor is just after an 'x'), an error occurs and
			insert mode does not start (this is Vi compatible).
			When  'cpoptions' does not include the 'E' flag, the
			"c" command always starts insert mode, even if there
			is no text to delete.

							*cc*
["x]cc			Delete [count] lines [into register x] and start
			insert (linewise).  If 'autoindent' is on, preserve
			the indent of the first line.

							*C*
["x]C			Delete from the cursor position to the end of the
			line and [count]-1 more lines [into register x], and
			start insert.  Synonym for c$ (not linewise).

							*s*
["x]s			Delete [count] characters [into register x] and start
			insert (s stands for Substitute).  Synonym for "cl"
			(not linewise).

							*S*
["x]S			Delete [count] lines [into register x] and start
			insert.  Synonym for "cc" (linewise).

{Visual}["x]c	or					*v_c* *v_s*
{Visual}["x]s		Delete the highlighted text [into register x] and
			start insert (for {Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not
			in Vi}

							*v_r*
{Visual}["x]r{char}	Replace all selected characters by {char}.

							*v_C*
{Visual}["x]C		Delete the highlighted lines [into register x] and
			start insert.  In Visual block mode it works
			differently |v_b_C|.  {not in Vi}
							*v_S*
{Visual}["x]S		Delete the highlighted lines [into register x] and
			start insert (for {Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not
			in Vi}
							*v_R*
{Visual}["x]R		Currently just like {Visual}["x]S.  In a next version
			it might work differently. {not in Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#

Notes:
- You can end Insert and Replace mode with <Esc>.
- See the section "Insert and Replace mode" |mode-ins-repl| for the other
  special characters in these modes.
- The effect of [count] takes place after Vim exits Insert or Replace mode.
- When the 'cpoptions' option contains '$' and the change is within one line,
  Vim continues to show the text to be deleted and puts a '$' at the last
  deleted character.

See |registers| for an explanation of registers.

Replace mode is just like Insert mode, except that every character you enter
deletes one character.  If you reach the end of a line, Vim appends any
further characters (just like Insert mode).  In Replace mode, the backspace
key restores the original text (if there was any).  (See section "Insert and
Replace mode" |mode-ins-repl|).

						*cw* *cW*
Special case: "cw" and "cW" work the same as "ce" and "cE" if the cursor is
on a non-blank.  This is because Vim interprets "cw" as change-word, and a
word does not include the following white space.  {Vi: "cw" when on a blank
followed by other blanks changes only the first blank; this is probably a
bug, because "dw" deletes all the blanks}

If you prefer "cw" to include the space after a word, use this mapping: >
	:map cw dwi
Or use "caw" (see |aw|).

==============================================================================
3. Simple changes					*simple-change*

#*# table:form=ref:label=simple-change 1:command 10:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*r*
r{char}			Replace the character under the cursor with {char}.
			If {char} is a <CR> or <NL>, a line break replaces the
			character.  To replace with a real <CR>, use CTRL-V
			<CR>.  CTRL-V <NL> replaces with a <Nul>.  {Vi: CTRL-V
			<CR> still replaces with a line break, cannot replace
			something with a <CR>} If you give a [count], Vim
			replaces [count] characters with [count] {char}s.
			When {char} is a <CR> or <NL>, however, Vim inserts
			only one <CR>: "5r<CR>" replaces five characters with
			a single line break.  When {char} is a <CR> or <NL>,
			Vim performs autoindenting.  This works just like
			deleting the characters that are replaced and then
			doing "i<CR><Esc>".
#*#table:stop-table #*#


						*case*
The following commands change the case of letters.

#*# table:form=ref:label=case 1:command 10:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*~*
~			'notildeop' option: Switch case of the character
			under the cursor and move the cursor to the right.
			If a [count] is given, do that many characters.
			{Vi: no count}
							*~{motion}*
~{motion}		'tildeop' option: switch case of {motion} text.
			{Vi: tilde cannot be used as an operator}

							*g~*
g~{motion}		Switch case of {motion} text. {not in Vi}

g~g~							*g~g~* *g~~*
g~~			Switch case of current line. {not in Vi}.

							*v_~*
{Visual}~		Switch case of highlighted text (for {Visual} see
			|Visual-mode|). {not in Vi}

							*v_U*
{Visual}U		Make highlighted text uppercase (for {Visual} see
			|Visual-mode|). {not in Vi}

							*gU* *uppercase*
gU{motion}		Make {motion} text uppercase. {not in Vi}
			Example: >
				:map! <C-F> <Esc>gUiw`]a
<			This works in Insert mode: press CTRL-F to make the
			word before the cursor uppercase.  Handy to type
			words in lowercase and then make them uppercase.


gUgU							*gUgU* *gUU*
gUU			Make current line uppercase. {not in Vi}.

							*v_u*
{Visual}u		Make highlighted text lowercase (for {Visual} see
			|Visual-mode|).  {not in Vi}

							*gu* *lowercase*
gu{motion}		Make {motion} text lowercase. {not in Vi}

gugu							*gugu* *guu*
guu			Make current line lowercase. {not in Vi}.
#*#table:stop-table #*#


Adding and subtracting ~
#*# table:form=ref 1:command 10:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*CTRL-A*
CTRL-A			Add [count] to the number or alphabetic character at
			or after the cursor.  {not in Vi}

							*CTRL-X*
CTRL-X			Subtract [count] from the number or alphabetic
			character at or after the cursor.  {not in Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#

The CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands work for (signed) decimal numbers, unsigned
octal and hexadecimal numbers and alphabetic characters.  This depends on the
'nrformats' option.
- When 'nrformats' includes "octal", Vim considers numbers starting with a '0'
  to be octal, unless the number includes a '8' or '9'.  Other numbers are
  decimal and may have a preceding minus sign.
  If the cursor is on a number, the commands apply to that number; otherwise
  Vim uses the number to the right of the cursor.
- When 'nrformats' includes "hex", Vim assumes numbers starting with '0x' or
  '0X' are hexadecimal.  The case of the rightmost letter in the number
  determines the case of the resulting hexadecimal number.  If there is no
  letter in the current number, Vim uses the previously detected case.
- When 'nrformats' includes "alpha", Vim will change the alphabetic character
  under or after the cursor.  This is useful to make lists with an alphabetic
  index.

For numbers with leading zeros (including all octal and hexadecimal numbers),
Vim preserves the number of characters in the number when possible.  CTRL-A on
"0077" results in "0100", CTRL-X on "0x100" results in "0x0ff".
There is one exception: When a number that starts with a zero is found not to
be octal (it contains a '8' or '9'), but 'nrformats' does include "octal",
leading zeros are removed to avoid that the result may be recognized as an
octal number.

Note that when 'nrformats' includes "octal", decimal numbers with leading
zeros cause mistakes, because they can be confused with octal numbers.

The CTRL-A command is very useful in a macro.  Example: Use the following
steps to make a numbered list.

1. Create the first list entry, make sure it starts with a number.
2. qa	     - start recording into register 'a'
3. Y	     - yank the entry
4. p	     - put a copy of the entry below the first one
5. CTRL-A    - increment the number
6. q	     - stop recording
7. <count>@a - repeat the yank, put and increment <count> times


SHIFTING LINES LEFT OR RIGHT				*shift-left-right*

#*# table:form=ref:label=shift-left-right 1:command 25:desc #*#
							*<*
<{motion}		Shift {motion} lines one 'shiftwidth' leftwards.

							*<<*
<<			Shift [count] lines one 'shiftwidth' leftwards.

							*v_<*
{Visual}[count]<	Shift the highlighted lines [count] 'shiftwidth'
			leftwards (for {Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not in
			Vi}

							*>*
 >{motion}		Shift {motion} lines one 'shiftwidth' rightwards.

							*>>*
 >>			Shift [count] lines one 'shiftwidth' rightwards.

							*v_>*
{Visual}[count]>	Shift the highlighted lines [count] 'shiftwidth'
			rightwards (for {Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not in
			Vi}

							*:<*
:[range]<		Shift [range] lines one 'shiftwidth' left.  Repeat '<'
			for shifting multiple 'shiftwidth's.

:[range]< {count}	Shift {count} lines one 'shiftwidth' left, starting
			with [range] (default current line |cmdline-ranges|).
			Repeat '<' for shifting multiple 'shiftwidth's.

							*:>*
:[range]> [flags]	Shift {count} [range] lines one 'shiftwidth' right.
			Repeat '>' for shifting multiple 'shiftwidth's.
			See |ex-flags| for [flags].

:[range]> {count} [flags]
			Shift {count} lines one 'shiftwidth' right, starting
			with [range] (default current line |cmdline-ranges|).
			Repeat '>' for shifting multiple 'shiftwidth's.
			See |ex-flags| for [flags].
#*#table:stop-table #*#

The ">" and "<" commands are handy for changing the indentation within
programs.  Use the 'shiftwidth' option to set the size of the white space
which these commands insert or delete.  Normally the 'shiftwidth' option is 8,
but you can set it to, say, 3 to make smaller indents.  The shift leftwards
stops when there is no indent.  The shift right does not affect empty lines.

If the 'shiftround' option is on, the indent is rounded to a multiple of
'shiftwidth'.

When the 'expandtab' option is off (this is the default) Vim uses <Tab>s as
much as possible to make the indent.  You can use ">><<" to replace an indent
made out of spaces with the same indent made out of <Tab>s (and a few spaces
if necessary).  If the 'expandtab' option is on, Vim uses only spaces.  Then
you can use ">><<" to replace <Tab>s in the indent by spaces (or use
":retab!").

To move a line several 'shiftwidth's, use Visual mode or the ":" commands.
For example: >
	Vjj4>		move three lines 4 indents to the right
	:<<<		move current line 3 indents to the left
	:>> 5		move 5 lines 2 indents to the right
	:5>>		move line 5 2 indents to the right

==============================================================================
4. Complex changes					*complex-change*

4.1 Filter commands					*filter*

A filter is a program that accepts text at standard input, changes it in some
way, and sends it to standard output.  You can use the commands below to send
some text through a filter, so that it is replace by the filter output.
Examples of filters are "sort", which sorts lines alphabetically, and
"indent", which formats C program files (you need a version of indent that
works like a filter; not all versions do).  The 'shell' option specifies the
shell Vim uses to execute the filter command (See also the 'shelltype'
option).  You can repeat filter commands with ".".  Vim does not recognize a
comment (starting with '"') after the ":!" command.

See the end of the Colon Commands reference doc for a list of
available filename-modifiers.

#*# table:form=ref:label=filter 1:command 3:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*!*
!{motion}{filter}	Filter {motion} text through the external program
			{filter}.

							*!!*
!!{filter}		Filter [count] lines through the external program
			{filter}.

							*v_!*
{Visual}!{filter}	Filter the highlighted lines through the external
			program {filter} (for {Visual} see |Visual-mode|).
			{not in Vi}

:{range}![!]{filter} [!][arg]				*:range!*
			Filter {range} lines through the external program
			{filter}.  Vim replaces the optional bangs with the
			latest given command and appends the optional [arg].
			Vim saves the output of the filter command in a
			temporary file and then reads the file into the
			buffer.

							*=*
={motion}		Filter {motion} lines through the external program
			given with the 'equalprg' option.  When the 'equalprg'
			option is empty (this is the default), use the
			internal formatting function to set the indent of each
			line |C-indenting|.

							*==*
==			Filter [count] lines through the external program
			given with the 'equalprg' option.  When the 'equalprg'
			option is empty (this is the default), use the
			internal formatting function |C-indenting|.

							*v_=*
{Visual}=		Filter the highlighted lines through the external
			program given with the 'equalprg' option.  When the
			'equalprg' option is empty (this is the default),
			use the internal formatting function |C-indenting|.
			(for {Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not in Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#


4.2 Substitute						*:substitute*
					                *:s* *:su*
:[range]s[ubstitute]/{pattern}/{string}/[c][e][g][p][r][i][I] [count]
			For each line in [range] replace a match of {pattern}
			with {string}.  See |:s_flags| for the flags.

							*:s_flags*
The arguments that you can use for the substitute commands:
[c]	Confirm each substitution.  Vim positions the cursor on the matching
	string.  You can type:				*:s_c*
	    'y'	    to substitute this match
	    'l'	    to substitute this match and then quit ("last")
	    'n'	    to skip this match
	    <Esc>   to skip this match
	    'a'	    to substitute this and all remaining matches {not in Vi}
	    'q'	    to quit substituting {not in Vi}
	    CTRL-E  to scroll the screen up {not in Vi}
	    CTRL-Y  to scroll the screen down {not in Vi}.
[g]	Replace all occurrences in the line.  Without this argument,
	replacement occurs only for the first occurrence in each line.  If
	the 'edcompatible' option is on, Vim remembers this flag and toggles
	it each time you use it, but resets it when you give a new search
	pattern.  If the 'gdefault' option is on, this flag is on by default
	and the [g] argument switches it off.
[p]	Print the line containing the last substitute.

If the {pattern} for the substitute command is empty, the command uses the
pattern from the last substitute or ":global" command.

For compatibility with Vi these two exceptions are allowed:
"\/{string}/" and "\?{string}?" do the same as "//{string}/r".
"\&{string}&" does the same as "//{string}/".

Instead of the '/' which surrounds the pattern and replacement string, you
can use any other character, but not an alphanumeric character, '\', '"' or
'|'.  This is useful if you want to include a '/' in the search pattern or
replacement string.  Example:
>	:s+/+//+

						*sub-replace-special*
Some characters in {string} have a special meaning:


magic		  action    ~
  &		  replaced with the whole matched pattern	     *s/\&*
 \&		  replaced with &
      \0	  replaced with the whole matched pattern	   *\0* *s/\0*
      \1	  replaced with the matched pattern in the first
		  pair of ()					     *s/\1*
      \2	  replaced with the matched pattern in the second
		  pair of ()					     *s/\2*
      ..	  ..						     *s/\3*
      \9	  replaced with the matched pattern in the ninth
		  pair of ()					     *s/\9*
      \r	  split line in two at this point		     *s/\r*
      \n	  idem						     *s/\n*
      \b	  insert a <BS>					     *s/\b*
      \t	  insert a <Tab>				     *s/\t*
      \\	  insert a single backslash			     *s/\\*
      \x	  where x is any character not mentioned above:
		  Reserved for future expansion



==============================================================================
5. Copying and moving text				*copy-move*

#*# table:form=ref:label=copy-move 1:command 10:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*quote*
"{a-zA-Z0-9.%#:-"}	Use register {a-zA-Z0-9.%#:-"} for next delete, yank
			or put (use uppercase character to append with
			delete and yank) ({.%#:} only work with put).

							*:reg* *:registers*
:reg[isters]		Display the contents of all numbered and named
			registers.  If a register is written to for |:redir|
			it will not be listed.
			{not in Vi}


:reg[isters] {arg}	Display the contents of the numbered and named
			registers that are mentioned in {arg}.  For example:
				:dis 1a
 			to display registers '1' and 'a'.  Spaces are allowed
			in {arg}.  {not in Vi}

							*:di* *:display*
:di[splay] [arg]	Same as :registers.  {not in Vi}

							*y* *yank*
["x]y{motion}		Yank {motion} text [into register x].  When no
			characters are to be yanked (e.g., "y0" in column 1),
			this is an error when 'cpoptions' includes the 'E'
			flag.

							*yy*
["x]yy			Yank [count] lines [into register x] (linewise).

							*Y*
["x]Y			yank [count] lines [into register x] (synonym for
			yy, linewise).  If you like "Y" to work from the
			cursor to the end of line (which is more logical,
			but not Vi-compatible) use ":map Y y$".

							*v_y*
{Visual}["x]y		Yank the highlighted text [into register x] (for
			{Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not in Vi}

							*v_Y*
{Visual}["x]Y		Yank the highlighted lines [into register x] (for
			{Visual} see |Visual-mode|).  {not in Vi}

							*:y* *:yank*
:[range]y[ank] [x]	Yank [range] lines [into register x].

:[range]y[ank] [x] {count}
			Yank {count} lines, starting with last line number
			in [range] (default: current line |cmdline-ranges|),
			[into register x].

							*p* *put*
["x]p			Put the text [from register x] after the cursor
			[count] times.  {Vi: no count}

["x]P		    or					*P* *<MiddleMouse>*
["x]<MiddleMouse>	Put the text [from register x] before the cursor
			[count] times.  Using the mouse only works when
			'mouse' contains 'n' or 'a'.  {Vi: no count}

							*gp*
["x]gp			Just like "p", but leave the cursor just after the new
			text.  {not in Vi}

							*gP*
["x]gP			Just like "P", but leave the cursor just after the new
			text.  {not in Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#

You can use these commands to copy text from one place to another.  Do this
by first getting the text into a register with a yank, delete or change
command, then inserting the register contents with a put command.  You can
also use these commands to move text from one file to another, because Vim
preserves all registers when changing buffers (the CTRL-^ command is a quick
way to toggle between two files).

				*linewise-register* *characterwise-register*
You can repeat the put commands with "." (except for :put) and undo them.  If
the command that was used to get the text into the register was linewise, Vim
inserts the text below ("p") or above ("P") the line where the cursor is.
Otherwise Vim inserts the text after ("p") or before ("P") the cursor.  With
the ":put" command, Vim always inserts the text in the next line.  You can
exchange two characters with the command sequence "xp".  You can exchange two
lines with the command sequence "ddp".  You can exchange two words with the
command sequence "deep" (start with the cursor in the blank space before the
first word).  You can use the "']" or "`]" command after the put command to
move the cursor to the end of the inserted text, or use "'[" or "`[" to move
the cursor to the start.

Note that after a yank command, Vim leaves the cursor on the first yanked
character that is closest to the start of the buffer.  This means that "yl"
doesn't move the cursor, but "yh" moves the cursor one character left.
Rationale:	In Vi the "y" command followed by a backwards motion would
		sometimes not move the cursor to the first yanked character,
		because redisplaying was skipped.  In Vim it always moves to
		the first character, as specified by Posix.

There are nine types of registers:			*registers*
1. The unnamed register ""
2. 10 numbered registers "0 to "9
4. 26 named registers "a to "z or "A to "Z
7. The selection register "*
8. The black hole register "_

1. Unnamed register ""				*quote_quote* *quotequote*
Vim fills this register with text deleted with the "d", "c", "s", "x" commands
or copied with the yank "y" command, regardless of whether or not a specific
register was used (e.g.  "xdd).  An exception is the '_' register: "_dd does
not store the deleted text in any register.  Vim uses the contents of this
register for any put command (p or P) which does not specify a register.
Additionally you can access it with the name '"'.  This means you have to type
two double quotes.  {Vi: register contents are lost when changing files, no
'"'}

2. Numbered registers "0 to "9		*quote_number* *quote0*	*quote1*
					*quote2* *quote3* *quote4* *quote9*
Vim fills these registers with text from yank and delete commands.  Numbered
register 0 contains the text from the most recent yank command, unless the
command specified another register with ["x].  Numbered register 1 contains
the text deleted by the most recent delete or change command, unless the
command specified another register or the text is less than one line (Vim puts
text deleted with "x" or "dw" in the small delete register).  With each
successive deletion or change, Vim shifts the previous contents of register 1
into register 2, 2 into 3, and so forth, losing the previous contents of
register 9.  {Vi: numbered register contents are lost when changing files;
register 0 does not exist}

4. Named registers "a to "z or "A to "Z			*quote_alpha* *quotea*
Vim fills these registers only when you say so.  Specify them as lowercase
letters to replace their previous contents or as uppercase letters to append
to their previous contents.

7. Selection register "*
Use this register for storing and retrieving the selected text for the GUI.
See |quotestar|.  When the clipboard is not available or not working, the
unnamed register is used instead.  {not in Vi}

8. Black hole register "_				*quote_*
When writing to this register, nothing happens.  This can be used to delete
text without affecting the normal registers.  When reading from this register,
nothing is returned.  {not in Vi}

If you use a put command without specifying a register, Vim uses the register
that was last filled (this is also the contents of the unnamed register).  If
you are confused, use the ":dis" command to find out what Vim will put (this
command displays all named and numbered registers; the unnamed register is
labelled '"').

The next three commands always work on whole lines.
