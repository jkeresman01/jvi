<h1>jVi Quick Start</h1>

<p>
There is a list of most of the
<a href="vimhelp/index.txt.html">normal and visual mode commands</a>
supported by jVi. In this list, the over 200 commands supported by jVi
are marked. The <span class="tt">'</span> and <span class="tt">"</span> for marks and
named buffers work as expected;
a <span class="tt">*</span> is a named buffer for the clipboard.
There are a few colon commands
available, try <span class="tt">:g/foo/s/bar/baz/gp</span>, and also see the platform
specific documentation for additional colon commands.
    There are several <a href="vimhelp/insert.txt.html">insert mode commands</a>
supported. And jVi sports a Ctrl-&lt; and Ctrl-&gt; in insert mode
to align with '('s on the previous line.
</p><p>
If you are a vi or vim user you can
just start using jVi and be comfortable.
There are a variety of options available 
<a href="#options">through a dialog</a>. Check the
<a href="vimhelp/help.txt.html">jVi Help Files</a>
for more information.
Almost all of the reference documentation is derived from the vim help files.
A subset of the vim help files are included. They are
modified to remove things that are not applicable. This is
detailed information on the commands and operation.
There are also some
<a href="doc_notes">jVi only features</a>.
</p>
<p>
jVi is embedded; where applicable, the
standard commands, for example "<span class="tt">:w</span>", are directed to the
application for execution.
There may be capabilities available
while editing that are provided by the primary application. For example,
when jVi is used within
<a href="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder" target="_top"> JBuilder</a>,
or
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target="_top">NetBeans</a>,
code completion works while editing.
The platform specific documentation about jVi should be consulted.
</p>

<p><a href="CHANGES.html">Recent changes to jVi</a>
is good for getting an feel for the available features.
</p>

<p>
<b> Log bugs at
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=3653" target="_top">
jVi Bug Tracking</a>.</b>
Please include both the <b>jVi version number</b> and the
<b>application version number</b>,
e.g. NetBeans 7.0, when reporting problems.
Get the version of jVi with the <span class="tt">:version</span> command,
also the version of jVi in use is displayed on the
<i>jVi Config</i> option property page..
</p>
<p>

Discuss your issues, problems and/or requests at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=10908">
jVi Open Discussion Forum</a>. 
This is a good way to indicate what you'd like to see in jVi for NetBeans.

<h2 id="search" class="MainSec00Font">Search and Command Entry</h2>
<p>
<b>Text search</b>, <span class="tt">"/"</span> and <span class="tt">"?"</span>,
uses the java regular expression syntax, mostly like perl, see
<A HREF="pattern.txt">Searching and Patterns</A>.
As in vim, by default characters like "(", "{" and "|" need to be escaped when part of the
regular expression syntax; if you don't want to escape
these characters there is an
options to change what needs escaping.
The java.util.regex package
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">
javadocs describe the pattern syntax</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When <span class="tt">"/"</span> is entered in normal mode,
    an entry window is pop'ed up just
    beneath the current editor pane, as shown on the right. This widget has
    a combo box UI; the history of search commands is available using
    the &lt;Up&gt; and &lt;Down&gt; arrows.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Command Entry</b>, after a <span class="tt">":"</span>,
    is similar.
</p>

<h2 id="options" class="MainSec00Font">Options</h2>
<p>
    <img SRC="images/jViOptionsExample.png"
         ALT="jVi Options Example"
         class="ImgRight"/>
    There are several options that control jVi's behavior. They
    are usually found
    though the application's <i>Options</i> menu.
    There are several tabs that contain jVi options. Most of these
    are well known vim options. If you click on an option name, a description of
    the option is displayed. The option names can generally be used in vim to get
    help if you want a more detailed description of what the option does.
</p>
<p>
    The values
    set through the UI are the default values for the options, so setting the
    values in the UI is like putting them in a .vimrc.
    jVi supports per file/buffer and per window options as in vim.
    <i>modeline</i>
    settings are applied after the UI option values.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="vimhelp/options.txt.html">jVi <span class="tt">:set</span> command</a>
    has several forms and what's implemented works mostly like vim.
    Currently, only a limited number of options can be used with the
    <span class="tt">:set</span> command. Use <span class="tt">:set all</span>
    to get a list of them.
</p>

<h2 id="keys" class="MainSec00Font">Key Bindings</h2>

<p>
Keybindings that are not caught by jVi are passed on to the embedding
application.
Configure the Keys that are caught by jVi though its
<i>Control-Key Bindings</i> and <i>Keypad Bindings</i>
options pages. If a key is not checked
(disabled) then it can be used for application keybindings.
