<b>&quot;jVi in NetBeans&quot; WishList 04/17/07</b>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="tt">:e</span> code completion for open and/or project files
        <br/> Probably want different commands, one for open files and
        the other for general and/or project files. Maybe bring up an open file
        browser for project files.
      </li>
      <li><span class="tt">:make</span>
        <br/>Need extensions for selected project, single file, project being
        edited.
      </li>
      <li>Debug commands
        <br/>single step, run until this line, etc. I was thinking of using
        <span class="tt">:x</span> to start a debug command.
        One "special" command I'd
        personall like to set up is "tracepoint": this is a
        breakpoint on the current line that doesn't stop any threads, but prints
        the current method/linenumber; it could bring up the customize
        breakpoint dialog with everything setup up so that a &lt;RET&gt; would close
        the dialog; but the caret would be positioned so that you could enter
        additional info to display
      </li>
      <li><span class="tt">Ctrl-W</span> window manipulation commands
        <br/>jVi is set up for a few these if the platform supports them. I
        haven't seen a NetBeans API for this type of functionality. I haven't
        asked yet either.
      </li>
      <li>clean up interactions with code folding</li>
    </ul>
