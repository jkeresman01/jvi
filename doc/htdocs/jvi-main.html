<h1 id="Introduction">jVi - vi/vim editor clone</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the jVi home page. Currently this page has some random
thoughts/comments, serve as the user documentation and get you
to
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvi/files/jVi-for-NetBeans"
   style="font-size: larger" target="_top">DOWNLOAD jVi for NetBeans</a>
and <a href="#Download">jVi for JBuilder download info</a>.
There is information about
integrating jVi.  Check out
<A HREF="CHANGES.html" TARGET="mainFrame"> Changes by release</A>
for good overview of features available with jVi.
</p>
<p style="font-size: larger">
jVi is a port of a major chunk of vim to java. It is not like many IDE
keybindings where, for example, I often hear stuff like "its similar to emacs
but not the same".
jVi is the same, try visual mode or map commands or
<span class="tt">:.,$s/([^ ]*) (.*$)/\2 \1/</span>
(you can set options so you don't need to escape '(' and other 
metacharacters in regular expressions) or
<span class="tt">"*2d3w</span> which deletes 6 words stashing them in the system
clipboard or <span class="tt">y%</span> or ... And, yes, "." works.
There is stuff missing, but if what's
there doesn't work like vi/vim then it's a bug (or a feature).

After a 5 year hiatus from Java, there's some personal projects I want to
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org" target="_top">
        <img SRC="images/BuiltForNetbeans.png"
        ALT="Built for NetBeans"
        class="ImgRight"/></a>
work on, 3D visualization of Sacred Geometry is one of them and there may be
some RCP. I wanted to use
an open source IDE, not JBuilder, and that means another port of jVi. I looked
at Eclipse, but the burden of SWT
was more than I would bear. Looking through some NetBeans mail archives
I was led to some work that Rich Unger did a few years ago to integrate jVi
into NetBeans; many thanks Rich. He
said he put it together in an evening; it was a good proof of concept, there
was vi behavior in the editor, but it was unusable for work. But that
starting point saved me countless hours. And now, with an editor I want to use,
I can start learning about NetBeans and get my personal projects going.

bug tracking and mailing lists.

<h2 id="Why_jVi" class="MainSec00Font">Why jVi?</h2>
<p> jVi is motivated by my frustration with the editors provided
by desktop apps, from mail readers to IDE's.&nbsp; The advent of java based
desktop apps, and the ability to extend them, makes it possible to put
together a vi which easily integrates into multiple disparate apps. A goal,
over time, is to make jVi fully functional with good performance. However
i believe there will always be performance limitations with jVi and expect to
continue using "native" editors for heavy duty tasks.
</p>
<p>jVi is patterned after
<a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>.
<a href="http://www.vim.org">
        <img SRC="images/vim_moolenaar_vimlogo.gif"
        ALT="Vim Logo" class="ImgRight"></a>
Vim is freely available charityware and running on a large number of
platforms, including for instance amiga and mac. Check out the site for
general vi pointers and documentation. jVi is a small subset of vim. Some
source code in jVi is taken from vim and modified to work in the java
environment.  The user documentation is almost exclusively from vim, only
modified to remove things that are not applicable.
