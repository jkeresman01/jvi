						*Insert* *Insert-mode*
Inserting and replacing text				*mode-ins-repl*

Most of this file is about Insert and Replace mode.  At the end are a few
commands for inserting text in other ways.

1. Special keys						|ins-special-keys|
2. Special special keys					|ins-special-special|
4. 'expandtab', 'smarttab' and 'softtabstop'  options	|ins-expandtab|
5. Replace mode						|Replace-mode|
8. Insert mode commands					|inserting|

==============================================================================
1. Special keys						*ins-special-keys*

In Insert and Replace mode, the following characters have a special meaning;
other characters are inserted directly.

NOTE: in insert mode, any unused control character takes you out of input mode.

char		action	~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#*# table:form=ref:label=ins-special-keys 1:command 12:extra-or 17:desc #*#
						*i_CTRL-[* *i_<Esc>*
<Esc>	   or	End insert or Replace mode, go back to Normal mode.  Finish
CTRL-[		abbreviation.
						*i_CTRL-@*
CTRL-@		Insert previously inserted text and stop insert.  {Vi: only
		when typed as first char, only up to 128 chars}
						*i_CTRL-A*
CTRL-A		Insert previously inserted text.  {not in Vi}
						*i_CTRL-H* *i_<BS>*
<BS>	   or	Delete the character before the cursor (see |i_backspacing|
CTRL-H		about joining lines).
		{Vi: does not delete autoindents}
						*i_<Del>*
<Del>		Delete the character under the cursor.  If the cursor is at
		the end of the line, and the 'backspace' option includes
		"eol", delete the <EOL>; the next line is appended after the
		current one.
		See |:fixdel| if your <Del> key does not do what you want.
		{not in Vi}
						*i_CTRL-W*
CTRL-W		Delete the word before the cursor (see |i_backspacing| about
		joining lines).  See the section "word motions",
		|word-motions|, for the definition of a word.
						*i_CTRL-U*
CTRL-U		Delete all entered characters in the current line (see
		|i_backspacing| about joining lines).

						*i_CTRL-I* *i_<Tab>*
<Tab>	   or	Insert a tab.  If the 'expandtab' option is on, the
CTRL-I		equivalent number of spaces is inserted. Also see the
                'softtabstop' option.

<NL>	   or					*i_CTRL-J* *i_<NL>*
CTRL-J		Begin new line.

<CR>	   or					*i_CTRL-M* *i_<CR>*
CTRL-M		Begin new line.
						*i_CTRL-N*
CTRL-N		Find next match for words that start with the
		keyword in front of the cursor, looking in places
		specified with the 'complete' option.  The found
		keyword is inserted in front of the cursor.

						*i_CTRL-P*
CTRL-P		Find previous match for words that start with the
		keyword in front of the cursor, looking in places
		specified with the 'complete' option.  The found
		keyword is inserted in front of the cursor.

CTRL-R {0-9a-z"%#*+:.-=}					*i_CTRL-R*
		Insert the contents of a register.  Between typing CTRL-R and
		the second character, '"' will be displayed to indicate that
		you are expected to enter the name of a register.
		The text is inserted as if you typed it.

CTRL-R CTRL-R {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-=}			*i_CTRL-R_CTRL-R*
		Insert the contents of a register.  Works like using a single
		CTRL-R, but the text is inserted literally, not as if typed.
		{not in Vi}

CTRL-R CTRL-O {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-=}			*i_CTRL-R_CTRL-O*
		Insert the contents of a register literally and don't
		auto-indent.

CTRL-R CTRL-P {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-=}			*i_CTRL-R_CTRL-P*
		Insert the contents of a register literally and fix the
		indent.

							*i_CTRL-T*
CTRL-T		Insert one shiftwidth of indent at the start of the current
		line.  The indent is always rounded to a 'shiftwidth' (this is
		vi compatible).  {Vi: only when in indent}
							*i_CTRL-D*
CTRL-D		Delete one shiftwidth of indent at the start of the current
		line.  The indent is always rounded to a 'shiftwidth' (this is
		vi compatible).  {Vi: CTRL-D works only when used after
		autoindent}
						*	i_CTRL-E*
CTRL-E		Insert the character which is below the cursor.  {not in Vi}
							*i_CTRL-Y*
CTRL-Y		Insert the character which is above the cursor.  {not in Vi}
		Note that for CTRL-E and CTRL-Y 'textwidth' is not used, to be
		able to copy characters from a long line.

							*i_<Insert>*
<Insert>	Toggle between insert and replace mode.  {not in Vi}

							*i_CTRL->*
CTRL->	   or	Align first non white character of current line with next
CTRL-.		parenthesis (column-wise) in previous line by inserting indent
		into current line.  Usefull for aligning arguments of a
		function call. Also anchors to first character of previous
		line. Think Ctrl-> for shift-like behavior. {jVi only}

							*i_CTRL-<*
CTRL-<	   or	Align first non white character of current line with previous
CTRL-,		parenthesis (column-wise) in previous line by removing indent
		from current line.  Usefull for aligning arguments of a
		function call. Also anchors to first character of previous
		line. Think Ctrl-< for shift-like behavior. {jVi only}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

						*i_backspacing*
The effect of the <BS>, CTRL-W, and CTRL-U depend on the 'backspace' option
(unless 'revins' is set).  This is a comma separated list of items:

item	    action ~
indent	    allow backspacing over autoindent
eol	    allow backspacing over end-of-line (join lines)
start	    allow backspacing over the start position of insert; CTRL-W and
	    CTRL-U stop once at the start position
(NOTE: jVi only support "0", "1" and "2")

When 'backspace' is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used.  You cannot
backspace over autoindent, before column 1 or before where insert started.

For backwards compatibility the values "0", "1" and "2" are also allowed, see
|'backspace'|.

If the 'backspace' option does contain "eol" and the cursor is in column 1
when one of the three keys is used, the current line is joined with the
previous line.  This effectively deletes the <EOL> in front of the cursor.
{Vi: does not cross lines, does not delete past start position of insert}

==============================================================================
2. Special special keys				*ins-special-special*

The following keys are special.  They stop the current insert, do something,
and then restart insertion.  This means you can do something without getting
out of Insert mode.  This is very handy if you prefer to use the Insert mode
all the time, just like editors that don't have a separate Normal mode.  You
may also want to set the 'backspace' option to "indent,eol,start" and set the
'insertmode' option. (NOTE: jVi does not support 'insertmode' option)

The changes (inserted or deleted characters) before and after these keys can
be undone separately.  Only the last change can be redone and always behaves
like an "i" command.

char		action	~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#*# table:form=ref:label=ins-special-special 1:command 18:desc 63:target#*#
 <Up>            cursor one line up                           *i_<Up>*
 <Down>          cursor one line down                         *i_<Down>*
 <Left>          cursor one character left                    *i_<Left>*
 <Right>         cursor one character right                   *i_<Right>*
 <S-Left>        cursor one word back (like "b" command)      *i_<S-Left>*
 <C-Left>        cursor one word back (like "b" command)      *i_<C-Left>*
 <S-Right>       cursor one word forward (like "w" command)   *i_<S-Right>*
 <C-Right>       cursor one word forward (like "w" command)   *i_<C-Right>*

 <C-Home>        cursor to first char in the file             *i_<C-Home>*
 <C-End>         cursor to after last char in the file        *i_<C-End>*
START-DOC-DEL
 <LeftMouse>     cursor to position of mouse click            *i_<LeftMouse>*
 <S-Up>          move window one page up                      *i_<S-Up>*
 <PageUp>        move window one page up                      *i_<PageUp>*
 <S-Down>        move window one page down                    *i_<S-Down>*
 <PageDown>      move window one page down                    *i_<PageDown>*
 <MouseDown>     scroll three lines down                      *i_<MouseDown>*
 <S-MouseDown>   scroll a full page down                      *i_<S-MouseDown>*
 <MouseUp>       scroll three lines up                        *i_<MouseUp>*
 <S-MouseUp>     scroll a full page up                        *i_<S-MouseUp>*
STOP-DOC-DEL
 CTRL-G u        break undo sequence, start new change        *i_CTRL-G_u*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When the 'whichwrap' option is set appropriately, the <Left> and <Right>
keys on the first/last character in the line make the cursor wrap to the
previous/next line.

==============================================================================
4. 'expandtab'                                      	*ins-expandtab*

If the 'expandtab' option is on, spaces will be used to fill the amount of
whitespace of the tab.  If you want to enter a real <Tab>, type CTRL-V first.
The 'expandtab' option is off by default.  Note that in Replace mode, a single
character is replaced with several spaces.  The result of this is that the
number of characters in the line increases.  Backspacing will delete one
space at a time.  The original character will be put back for only one space
that you backspace over (the last one).  {Vi does not have the 'expandtab'
option}

NOTE: in jVi the platform does a lot of the tab handling. Platform docs should
be referenced.


==============================================================================
5. Replace mode				*Replace* *Replace-mode* *mode-replace*

Enter Replace mode with the "R" command in normal mode.

In Replace mode, one character in the line is deleted for every character you
type.  If there is no character to delete (at the end of the line), the
typed character is appended (as in Insert mode).  Thus the number of
characters in a line stays the same until you get to the end of the line.
If a <NL> is typed, a line break is inserted and no character is deleted.

Be careful with <Tab> characters.  If you type a normal printing character in
its place, the number of characters is still the same, but the number of
columns will become smaller.

If you delete characters in Replace mode (with <BS>, CTRL-W, or CTRL-U), what
happens is that you delete the changes.  The characters that were replaced
are restored.  If you had typed past the existing text, the characters you
added are deleted.  This is effectively a character-at-a-time undo.

If the 'expandtab' option is on, a <Tab> will replace one character with
several spaces.  The result of this is that the number of characters in the
line increases.  Backspacing will delete one space at a time.  The original
character will be put back for only one space that you backspace over (the
last one).  {Vi does not have the 'expandtab' option}

==============================================================================
8. Insert mode commands					*inserting*

The following commands can be used to insert new text into the buffer.  They
can all be undone and repeated with the "." command.

#*# table:form=ref:label=inserting 1:command 17:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*a*
a			Append text after the cursor [count] times.

							*A*
A			Append text at the end of the line [count] times.

<insert>	or				*i* *insert* *<Insert>*
i			Insert text before the cursor [count] times.

							*I*
I			Insert text before the first non-blank in the line
			[count] times.

							*o*
o			Begin a new line below the cursor and insert text,
			repeat [count] times.
			{Vi: blank [count] screen lines}

							*O*
O			Begin a new line above the cursor and insert text,
			repeat [count] times.
			{Vi: blank [count] screen lines}
#*#table:stop-table #*#

These commands are used to start inserting text.  You can end insert mode with
<Esc>.  See |mode-ins-repl| for the other special characters in Insert mode.
the effect of [count] takes place after insert mode is exited.

When 'autoindent' is on, the indent for a new line is obtained from the
previous line. 

NOTE: in jVi the platform does a lot of the insert new line handling.
      Platform docs should be referenced.
