Repeating commands					*repeating*

1. Single repeats	|single-repeat|
3. Complex repeats	|complex-repeat|

==============================================================================
1. Single repeats					*single-repeat*

#*# table:form=ref:label=single-repeat 1:command 17:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*.*
.			Repeat last change, with count replaced with [count].
			Also repeat a yank command, when the 'y' flag is
			included in 'cpoptions'.
#*#table:stop-table #*#

Simple changes can be repeated with the "." command.  Without a count, the
count of the last change is used.  If you enter a count, it will replace the
last one.  If the last change included a specification of a numbered register,
the register number will be incremented.  See |undo-redo| for an example how
to use this.  Note that when repeating a command that used a Visual selection,
the same SIZE of area is used, see |visual-repeat|.

==============================================================================
3. Complex repeats					*complex-repeat*

#*# table:form=ref:label=complex-repeat 1:command 17:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*q* *recording*
q{0-9a-zA-Z"}		Record typed characters into register {0-9a-zA-Z"}
			(uppercase to append).  The 'q' command is disabled
			while executing a register, and it doesn't work inside
			a mapping.  {Vi: no recording}

q			Stops recording.  (Implementation note: The 'q' that
			stops recording is not stored in the register, unless
			it was the result of a mapping)  {Vi: no recording}

							*@*
@{0-9a-z".=*}		Execute the contents of register {0-9a-z".=*} [count]
			times.  Note that register '%' (name of the current
			file) and '#' (name of the alternate file) cannot be
			used.  For "@=" you are prompted to enter an
			expression.  The result of the expression is then
			executed.  See also |@:|.  {Vi: only named registers}

							*@@*
@@			Repeat the previous @{0-9a-z":*} [count] times.
#*#table:stop-table #*#

All commands and command sequences can be repeated by putting them in a named
register and then executing it.  There are two ways to get the commands in the
register:
- Use the record command "q".  You type the commands once, and while they are
  being executed they are stored in a register.  Easy, because you can see
  what you are doing.  If you make a mistake, "p"ut the register into the
  file, edit the command sequence, and then delete it into the register
  again.  You can continue recording by appending to the register (use an
  uppercase letter).
- Delete or yank the command sequence into the register.
