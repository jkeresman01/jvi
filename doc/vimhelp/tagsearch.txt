Tags and special searches				*tags-and-searches*

1. Jump to a tag		|tag-commands|
2. Tag stack			|tag-stack|

==============================================================================
1. Jump to a tag					*tag-commands*

							*tags*
A tag is an identifier that appears in a "tags" file.  It is a sort of label
that can be jumped to.  For example: In C programs each function name can be
used as a tag.  The "tags" file has to be generated by a program like ctags,
before the tag commands can be used.

With the ":tag" command the cursor will be positioned on the tag.  With the
CTRL-] command, the keyword on which the cursor is standing is used as the
tag.  If the cursor is not on a keyword, the first keyword to the right of the
cursor is used.

The ":tag" command works very well for C programs.  If you see a call to a
function and wonder what that function does, position the cursor inside of the
function name and hit CTRL-].  This will bring you to the function definition.
An easy way back is with the CTRL-T command.  Also read about the tag stack
below.

#*# table:form=ref:label=tag-commands 1:command 17:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*:ta* *:tag*
:ta[g] {ident}  	Jump to the definition of {ident}, using the
			information in the tags file(s).  Put {ident} in the
			tag stack.
			{ident} can be a regexp pattern, see |tag-regexp|.

CTRL-]			Same as ":tag {ident}", where {ident} is the keyword
			under or after cursor.  {Vi: identifier after the
			cursor}

							*v_CTRL-]*
{Visual}CTRL-]		Same as ":tag {ident}", where {ident} is the text that
			is highlighted.  {not in Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#


==============================================================================
2. Tag stack						*tag-stack* *tagstack*

On the tag stack is remembered which tags you jumped to, and from where.

#*# table:form=ref:label=tag-stack 1:command 17:extra-or 25:desc #*#
							*CTRL-T*
CTRL-T			Jump to [count] older entry in the tag stack
			(default 1).  {not in Vi}

							*:po* *:pop*
:[count]po[p]   	Jump to [count] older entry in tag stack (default 1).
			{not in Vi}

:[count]ta[g]   	Jump to [count] newer entry in tag stack (default 1).
			{not in Vi}

							*:tags*
:tags			Show the contents of the tag stack.  The active
			entry is marked with a '>'.  {not in Vi}
#*#table:stop-table #*#

The output of ":tags" looks like this:

   # TO tag      FROM line in file/line
   1 main		 1  harddisk2:text/vim/test
 > 2 FuncA		58  i = FuncA(10);
   3 FuncC	       357  harddisk2:text/vim/src/amiga.c

This list shows the tags that you jumped to and the cursor position before
that jump.  The older tags are at the top, the newer at the bottom.

The '>' points to the active entry.  This is the tag that will be used by the
next ":tag" command.  The CTRL-T and ":pop" command will use the position
above the active entry.

Below the "TO" is the number of the current match in the match list.  Note
that this doesn't change when using ":pop" or ":tag".

The line number and file name are remembered to be able to get back to where
you were before the tag command.  The line number will be correct, also when
deleting/inserting lines, unless this was done by another program (e.g.
another instance of Vim).

For the current file, the "file/line" column shows the text at the position.
An indent is removed and a long line is truncated to fit in the window.

You can jump to previously used tags with several commands.  Some examples:

	":pop" or CTRL-T	to position before previous tag
	{count}CTRL-T		to position before {count} older tag
	":tag"			to newer tag
	":0tag"			to last used tag

The most obvious way to use this is while browsing through the call graph of
a program.  Consider the following call graph:

	main  --->  FuncA  --->  FuncC
	      --->  FuncB

(Explanation: main calls FuncA and FuncB; FuncA calls FuncC).
You can get from main to FuncA by using CTRL-] on the call to FuncA.  Then
you can CTRL-] to get to FuncC.  If you now want to go back to main you can
use CTRL-T twice.  Then you can CTRL-] to FuncB.

If you issue a ":ta {ident}" or CTRL-] command, this tag is inserted at the
current position in the stack.  If the stack was full (it can hold up to 20
entries), the oldest entry is deleted and the older entries shift one
position up (their index number is decremented by one).  If the last used
entry was not at the bottom, the entries below the last used one are
deleted.  This means that an old branch in the call graph is lost.  After the
commands explained above the tag stack will look like this:

   # TO tag	FROM line in file
   1 main	        1  harddisk2:text/vim/test
   2 FuncB	       59  harddisk2:text/vim/src/main.c
