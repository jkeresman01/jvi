This is the main package of the jVi editor; it contains the interfaces that
jVi works with.
The primary editing engine is in {@link com.raelity.jvi.core}.
</p>
<p>
<b>If you want to work on the source in this package, you should pick up
a copy of the vim source, v5.4, from the 
<a href="http://www.vim.org" target="_top">
vim website</a>.</b> This applies especially to
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Normal},
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Edit},
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.ColonCommands},
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Misc}.
and {@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Misc01}.
The class files Misc and Misc01
contain functions from several vim C files, including
misc1.c, misc2.c, ops.c, ui.c, screen.c, undo.c, charset.c,
ex_getln.c, term.c and window.c.
Finally there is the class file
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Util}
which contains random stuff. It should probably be put
into Misc.
</p>

<h3>Embedding and Porting Notes</h3>

<p>
jVi is embedded in an application by implementing several interfaces
through which the vi editing engine works on its environment. These
are tasks such as adding and deleting text, view manipulation and
file IO. The main editor accesses these various interfaces through
{@link com.raelity.jvi.ViFactory}.
A {@link com.raelity.jvi.ViFactory} is implemented that creates
concrete instantiations of the various interfaces. Access to the
factory and other capabilities is co-ordinated throug the
{@link com.raelity.jvi.manager.ViManager}
class. Take a look at 
{@link org.jbopentools.editor.jbvi}
and
{@link com.raelity.jvi.cmd}
for examples of jvi embedded in an application.
</p>
<p>
A key interface for embedding jVi is
{@link com.raelity.jvi.ViTextView}.
This interface is used to access the display and text.
There is a swing implementation,
{@link com.raelity.jvi.swing.SwingTextView},
for swing that works with
a JEditorPane and Document. If jVi is being embedded
in a swing application you can probably subclass
{@link com.raelity.jvi.swing.simple.SimpleTextView}
as a starting point. There are methods
in this interface, win_*, which provide for the manipulation
of edit views (windows); they probably should be
in a separate class.
</p>
<p>
File handling is provided through the
{@link com.raelity.jvi.ViFS}
interface. Status and other messages are
output through the
{@link com.raelity.jvi.ViStatusDisplay},
interface.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways in which jVi captures keystrokes, through
normal mode and through command line entry. Line entry is
for specifying colon commands and search patterns. There is an
interface,
{@link com.raelity.jvi.ViCmdEntry},
through which command mode entry is done.
There are two implementations of higher level gui objects which
have ViCmdEntry as part of them,
{@link com.raelity.jvi.swing.WindowCmdEntry}
and
{@link com.raelity.jvi.swing.DefaultCmdEntry}.
Only WindowCmdEntry should be used for now because it is modal.
</p>

<h3>Colon Commands</h3>

<p>
It is pretty simple to add new colon commands,
use {@link com.raelity.jvi.core.ColonCommands#register(
String, String, ActionListener, Set)}.
The handler for
a colon command is an Action.
Colon command handling is in the class
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.ColonCommands}.
If a colon command takes no arguments,
then you can register a
{@link java.awt.event.ActionListener}
to handle the command. If the command takes arguments, then you
register a 
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.ColonCommands.ColonAction}
to handle the command. A 
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.ColonCommands.ColonEvent}
is passed to the action that handles a colon command. Through
this event the arguments to the command can be accessed.
The command that was used to invoke the action is also available,
so a single action could handle multiple commands; and there are
other techniques to achieve this affect.
</p>

<h3>Normal Mode Command Parsing</h3>

<p>

Normal mode Vi comands can have up to three chunks: buffer-operator-motion.
For example: <b>"a3y4&lt;CR&gt;</b> has
</p>
<ul>
  <li>buffer: "a</li>
  <li>operator: 3y</li>
  <li>motion: 4&lt;CR&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>
The original vim invokes normal,
similar in function to jVi's {@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Normal},
3 times, one for each chunk. The caller
had no knowledge of how many chunks there are in a single command,
it just called normal in a loop. normal kept control,
calling safe_getc as needed to pick up all the
characters that make up a chunk, and returned as each chunk was completed.
Accumulated information was saved in OPARG.
normal detected when a complete command was ready and then executed it,
often times in do_pending_op.
CMDARG has per chunk information, and OPARG is cleared after each
command.
</p>
<p>
To fit into a java gui environment, we want to be able to handle and parse one
character at a time as delivered through an action from
the event thread. This means we have to return
after each character. So we must maintain a bunch of "where am i" state
information between each character. The original code is more or less
intact surrounded by a variety of "what state am i in" conditionals;
this is messy.  Input characters come in through
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Normal#processInputChar}.
<br><b>NEEDSWORK:</b>get the char parsing to look like a classic state
machine this should at least keep it manageable;
actually, if run outside the event queue as a separate thread,
then could have a sleeping getChar.
</p><p>
Operator and motion are very similar, syntacticly they are usually like
<b>[&lt;count&gt;]&lt;char&gt;</b>
or sometimes more than one char. A motion can also be a search.
</p>

<h3>Working with Three types of Options</h3>

<p>
<i>vim/vi</i> have three types of options: global, buffer and window.
jVi mirrors this structure (finally in 2007 per buffer/document options
are supported).
Global options are static and are found in {@link G}. Per file  options
are in {@link com.raelity.jvi.core.Buffer} and per window options are in
{@link com.raelity.jvi.core.TextView}.
Both <code>Buffer</code> and <code>ViTextView</code> implement
{@link com.raelity.jvi.ViOptionBag}. <code>ViOptionBag</code> is the
primary source of information about handling options.
Multiple views/windows
of the same document share the <code>Buffer</code> variables;
for example, if you do ":set sw=8" on a file,
any open windows into that file all have the same shiftwidth.
