jVi is a vi/vim editor clone,
if you are interested in its guts then see the main
<a href="com/raelity/jvi/package-summary.html#package_description">
package description</a>.
The intention is that jVi be embedded in
various applications, for example IDEs and news/mail readers. To meet this
goal, jVi is organized to make it easy to plug into an application.
The package {@link com.raelity.jvi} is the
primary editing engine. It processes all the vi commands and performs
text manipullations. It gets access to its environment through a series
of interfaces. The package {@link com.raelity.jvi.swing} has most of the
substance of a port of jVi to the swing package. {@link com.raelity.jvi.cmd}
starts up a JEditorPane with some text and jVi keybindings attached to it.
This is useful for debugging. With any argument, a second JEditorPane is
started that reference the same document as the first.
